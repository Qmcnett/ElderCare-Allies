# ElderCare-Allies
Created a website to provide support for seniors experiencing social loneliness and to raise awareness about these issues, inspiring others to take action by volunteering. The website aims to serve as a platform for connecting seniors with much-needed companionship and assistance while also motivating individuals to contribute their time and efforts toward addressing the prevalent issue of social isolation among the elderly.
